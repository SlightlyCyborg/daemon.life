## What is edencybernetics.life?

The main goal of Eden Cybernetics is to use cybernetic organisms I call "daemons" to improve life for earthlings (and future Martians, Elon willing).


## Current/Future Projects

* Augment myself using AI and teach others how to do the same.
* Build a framework for people to easily build custom robots for themselves.
* Improve agriculture on Earth with gardens worked by robots.
* Start agriculture on Mars using robots
* Build a really awesome cybernetics YouTube channel

## Product/Project History

### BB8 (Fall 2015 - Spring 2016)

I wanted to build a BB8 for the first new Starwars Launch. The build was behind schedule, over budget, and the head kept falling of. It was very educational and fun though!

### AI Daemon (Summer/Fall 2016)

Eventually, the AI personality became divorced from the BB8 robot itself and the project took on a life of its own and I had launched a kickstarter for the project.

### A Follow Me Camera Bot (Spring 2017)

I developed a very simple robot with a single axis of rotation that can make a laptop with a webcam follow a person when they move out of frame (left or right)

I put that project blueprints and code up on my website and sold a few copies!


### The Dragon Robot (Summer 2017)

This was an experiment to see how far I could take my design skills.

I added a smart phone to the face and used it to get the robot to talk and control the Bluetooth motor drivers in the neck.

### The spider bot (Summer 2017)

I began work on a spider robot, but it was too complex and became a dead end.

### The IndieGoGo Launch. (Summer 2017)

On July 14, 2017 I had my first significant entrepreneurial success. I built motor mount that can move around the popular Structure Sensor on a 2d axis.

The launch netted me $228 in revenue, $96 of which is in donations for open sourcing the project. 

2 people bought the product.

The structure sensor costs > $300. This means that I could only market the device to people who already owned the structure sensor.

### The TY Beanie Baby Robot. (Summer 2017)
